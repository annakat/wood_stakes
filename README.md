# Controls of initial wood decomposition on and in forest soils using standard material
Risch et al. 2022 - Frontiers in Forests and Global Change
 
## Contains:
1) SEM scripts: For fitting piece-wise structural equation models to assess decomposition of standard wood stakes on top of the surface organic horizons (surface), at the interface between the surface organic horizons and mineral soil (interface) and in the mineral soil (mineral), as well as for models including climate variables only (climate).

2) Data: ``Risch_etal_Frontiers.csv`` contains data from standard wood stakes made from aspen and loblolly pine incubated across 44 unharvested forest stands distributed across the northern hemisphere.
